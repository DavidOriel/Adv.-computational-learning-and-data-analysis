EX0 - Pytorch basics 
This directory contains IPYNB with simple exercises to understand pytorch library.

EX1 - 
NN.ipynb - Notebooke where i built a complete and flexible library free neural network.
Outograd.ipynb - Notebook where i research the Autograd feature for gradient computations

EX2- 
CNN_RNN.ipynb - Notebook where i have built a complete, library free CNN and RNN.
